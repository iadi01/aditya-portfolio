Similarly, the Weather App queries the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch geolocation atmospheric forecasts. Proper API design involves using correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returning semantic status codes.",

Next.js is a full-featured framework built on React that handles server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and routing out of the box.",
      "For simple single-page applications (SPAs) like this portfolio, client-side React is highly effective and offers fast page speeds. However, for large-scale platforms that require strong SEO and dynamic metadata, a Next.js structure is helpful because pages are pre-rendered on the server for indexing.",
      "Next.js also provides API routing, image optimization components, and code splitting natively. As a React developer, I evaluate both paths. React is perfect for highly interactive interfaces, while Next.js is ideal for content-heavy pages that demand indexation."
